Static keyword:

-variable : the object will share common space.
-block : it is executed whenever .class file is created. 
-method : static method doesn't need object for it's execution. 
          example : public static void main()
          It is used to mainly access methods independent of object creation.
          
Abstract Classes:
-Abstract classes are classes having at least one abstract method.
-Objects cannot be created for Abstract classes.
-Constructors can be created for Abstract classes.

Abstract Methods:
-Abstract methods are methods which don't have definition.
 eg : public abstract void payment();

Interface:
-Java elements consisting all abstract methods.
-objects and constructors can't be created.
-variable can't be declared but can declare constants.
-every method under interface is "public abstract" by default.

Final Keyword: Accessed modifier
