Constructor : It is a special method having same name as class.
			  It does't have any return type.
			  It will automatically be created when an object is created.
			  Types:
			  -Default Constructor or zero parameterized Constructor.
			  	(user or system)
			  -Parameterized Constructor
			   (user)
			  -Copy Constructor
			   (user)
Constructor Overloading : A class having more than 1 constructor.
						- Student(String name){}
			 			- Student(String name, int age){}
			 			
If we give same name to class variable and method variable. 
higher preference is of method variable, so it can't distinguish age = age, 
doesn't know which one is class variable and which one is method variable, 
because of preference method variable "age" has the value but
while printing the values it takes value from class variable which is empty that is why it is displaying null.
		
Constructor(String n,int age) 
	    {
			name=n;
			age=age; //default value
			System.out.println("Constructor ...");
		}
